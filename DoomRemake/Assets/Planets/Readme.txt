Textures Size
The  planets have a texture size of 2K. We quite understand that some people would prefer a higher resolution of 4K or 8K, but we have experimented briefly with 4K and the result was that fewer people were willing to buy this collection as a result of the larger file size and the added resolution didn't really make that big of a difference for most users.

These planets were designed to be used as background objects and not to be something zoomed into with close-up camera shots. For that, even 8K will not be enough.

Additionally, we reduced the texture size to 1K wherever we saw it possible to do so without affecting the quality, such as in metallic/smoothness or emission maps.

Included Script & Shaders
The script is only used to rotate the stars corona to make it feel animated.

The star shader is used to give the stars a fresnel effect and the planet atmosphere shader is used with the corona to make it invisible if viewed at an angle and only visible if viewed straight ahead.
