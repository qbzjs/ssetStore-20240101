DOCUMENTATION


This asset contains a large collection of different Sci-Fi Displays for Builtin RP and URP. 
There are also prefabs for some individual parts e.g. screws, pipes, mounts, lights and so on, if you want add more of them to a certain display. 
These high quality displays are perfect for desktops, consoles, and high end mobile devices.


Please note:

When importing the asset to your project you only need to import the desired render pipeline folder (Builtin RP, URP, HDRP) and the General folder + Demo and Post Processing if you want.
If you switch between Builtin RP demo, URP demo and HDRP demo don‘t forget to remove or add the RenderPipelineAsset in Project Settings -> Graphics -> Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings. If you want to use the URP or HDRP demo don't forget to install URP or HDRP from the package manager.

You can find the RenderPipelineAsset in URP/RenderPipeline/UniversalRenderPipelineAsset

DisplayRotation script:
The Com Display has a rotation script to rotate the displays axe between -90 and +90 degrees. You can define the rotation speed, rotation angle and delay. 
The delay defines the time in seconds after which the rotation starts. If you need a longer time than 25 seconds, just increase the Range max. value in the script.
You can also change the rotation axe if you want to use the script somewhere else. This script must be attached to the Top_Mount_Axe and the rotation axe must be set to X for the Com Display.

MoveTelescopeMount script:
This script is used to move the telescope mount up to a percentage value between 0% - 100%. You can define the move distance, move speed and delay.
The move speed defines how fast the mount moves upwards.
You can also define a delay after which the telescope mount starts moving up. If you need a longer time than 25 seconds, just increase the Range max. value in the script.
This script must be attached to the Telescope_Mount.

LaptopDisplayRotation script:
This script rotates the lower and upper part of the laptop displays.
You can define a delay when the rotation starts. You can also define the rotation angle and rotation speed.
Feel free to extend the script for your own needs.

LaptopSideDisplay script:
This script moves the side displays out of the upper display or move them into the zpper display. You can define the start and end position and the speed.
You can also define a delay. The static MoveOut property defines the direction.
This is just an example script. You can extend it for your needs.

SciFiTablet03ButtonController:
This script contols the button animation of the Sci_Fi_Tablet_03. The tablet has a UI canvas with transparent buttons above all buttons to trigger the animation by a mouse click.
If you don't need the button animation you can remove the ButtonPanel from the canvas and remove the script.

4096 x 4096 textures for main display parts.
512 x 512, 1024 x 1024 and 2048 x 2048 textures for small objects like screws and pipes or mask maps.

Tip:

To reduce the polygon count you can remove some screws from the display. I will optimize screws in a future build.
At some displays you can increase or reduce the metallic alpha smoothness effect in the materials shader editor with the smoothness slider.
